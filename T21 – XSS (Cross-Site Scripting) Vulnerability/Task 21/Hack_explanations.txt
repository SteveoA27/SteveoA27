The 3 hack txt files all inject the hack() function that exists inside the vulnerability.py file. Each one works it way around the potential input
that they are likely to see, hack1 being a sum-based hack, hack2 reads in a number and adds 1, but this is commented out by the hack 
and hack 3 which takes a name input and leaves it as a blank input before joining that to the hack() function and calling the function 
through the vulnerability.py file.
