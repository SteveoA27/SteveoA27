Welcome to my Chessboard Game 

I have built an automated chessboard to show how OOP is flexiable and that objects can interact within the main class
The idea was to create the board and to then construct chess pieces with their designated moves.

The content of this project is as follows

The board in board.py
The chess figure movements in chess_figure.py
The ability for the move to happen in chess_figure_stb.py
Then the chess piece of Pawn in pawn.py

Nothing needs to be installed, it is best used in VScode. 

The code should be run in the order of contents.
